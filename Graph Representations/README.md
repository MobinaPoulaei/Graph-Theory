# Graph Representations

Welcome to the Graph Representations repository! This repository contains various methods and techniques for representing graphs, essential for understanding and implementing graph algorithms.

## Overview

Graph representation is a crucial aspect of graph theory, and it involves describing a graph in a structured way. This repository covers multiple methods of graph representation, including:

- **Adjacency Matrix:** A 2D array of size VxV where V is the number of vertices in a graph, and a cell value indicates the presence or absence of an edge.
- **Adjacency List:** An array of lists, where each list represents a vertex and contains all the adjacent vertices.
- **Incidence Matrix:** A matrix where rows represent vertices and columns represent edges, with cells indicating the incidence relationship.
