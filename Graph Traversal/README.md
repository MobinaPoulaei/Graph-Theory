# Graph Traversal Algorithms

Welcome to the Graph Traversal Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations and explanations of fundamental graph traversal algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## Overview

Graph traversal is a technique used to visit all the nodes in a graph. This repository covers two primary graph traversal algorithms:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** An algorithm that explores as far along a branch as possible before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** An algorithm that explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

These algorithms are essential for understanding more complex graph-related problems and algorithms.
